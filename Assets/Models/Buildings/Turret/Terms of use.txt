* Almost all my models have attached a document for "terms of use". Some of these documents are old so you should check my blog for the latest (updated) "terms of use" !

* All models are made by "SolCommand" from http://solcommand.blogspot.com/

* You can use my free stuff for ANY personal project that you want.

* For commercial projects pls send me an e-mail by going to the "contact" page.

* You can edit my ships, space stations and everything else, however you like (rename, retexture, edit the mesh, etc) just don't claim them as your own ;)

* I always appreciate when people contact me to tell me about their projects and how much my models helped them ... *hint* hehe.

* If you notice bugs or errors with a model pls let me know !

* DO NOT complain about texture quality ! I get bored fast when texturing so if you want a better texture you can always do one yourself ;) Also keep in mind these models are some of my oldest and done in my free time, so again, don't complain :)

* That's about it, enjoy them and remember people, make Love not War ! :)
